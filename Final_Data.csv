question,answer
i am not feeling well i feel really weak hopeless mood disturbances and stress due to my adhdhow do you explain this feeling,im sorry to hear that but do not worry this is a simple matter that we can treat or get rid of by following some instructions and implementing them accurately
well where do i begin with those instructions that make me envious moody and healthier,i want you to know that adhd depression is a treatable condition and with proper help you can get rid of it you can overcome it the first step we start with is to seek professional help from people with experience in this field
who are the people with expertise in the field of adhd,the people who can give you a helping hand to get out of the situation you are going through and they are me because i work and i have enough experience to make me give advice to get out of depression or hyperactivity disorder and the psychotherapist also offers that but what distinguishes me from the therapist is that i am available at time and everywhere
what if i dont seek help from you or those experienced people in the field of hyperactivity disorder treatment,if you dont seek help from me or people with experience in treating adhd you are likely to be experiencing difficulties and challenges managing the condition failure to seek appropriate help may affect your ability to cope with symptoms and achieve success in different areas of life

this is really because i do not like communicating with others especially communicating with them to ask for help from them is seeking professional help from you enough to get rid of hyperactivity disorder or not,asking for help from me alone is not enough in the sense that i give you advice and you are required to work on those tips in order to help yourself to get rid of these disturbances because if necessary you will inevitably go to the psychotherapist so that he can follow you and follow your behavior
does this mean that in order to overcome the stage of hyperactivity disorder and attention deficit i have to participate in a small part in helping myself in order to overcome that and you and the psychotherapist take the largest part,no asking for help to overcome this or your coming here should be based on your desire for a better life in order to enjoy physical and psychological health and with this you must have a lot of motivation to continue in the recovery phase because without those ambitions and motives it would be difficult

all is well in that step what is the next step we must take to recover from depression,its great that youve taken this step to start therapy and work on managing your depression to get the most out of our sessions it is important that you follow your treatment plan outside of treatment as well this may include practicing the coping strategies we discuss in session or taking any medication as prescribed
that makes sense i just feel like im not making progress and its frustrating honestly i had a hard time sticking to it i just feel so unmotivated and exhausted all the time what should i do to avoid failure in the treatment phase of depression,i know that but you must take care of the appointments of medication and communication with him in order to overcome this ordeal and not make it more difficult for you than this and in order not to reach a state in which it does not reach know how to come back again
i try a lot to stick to all of this in order to become a balanced person are there worse cases of depression and stress can i not go back or will i hardly go back,yes in the worst cases that reach the point of selfharm and harming others practicing therapy and sticking to its appointments will prevent you from reaching that stage and it will also help you get back to the mood you want again
oh my god ill try to keep my medication and therapy appointments and ill also attend all sessions regularly so i dont get to that point will the medication help me maintain a good mood,i understand that it can be difficult to stay motivated when youre feeling depressed yes of course following a treatment plan is important for controlling symptoms and improving your mental health
it is difficult to find the energy to do anything sometimes i forget to take my medications and have a hard time getting to my treatment appointments does not stick to the treatment plan make me feel lethargic and unable to move,i see it appears that some of the barriers may be related to your depressive symptoms its important to remember that your treatment plan is designed to help you manage those symptoms and that its okay to ask for help if you need it
can i set reminders for my medication appointments and trying to create a routine to make it easier to stick to my treatment plan for recovery from depression,these are great ideas setting reminders and establishing a routine can be very helpful for staying on track with your treatment plan its also important to remember that your treatment plan isnt static  if something isnt working or if you need extra support we can always make adjustments the most important thing for you is to communicate openly with me about how you feel and what you need to deal with your depression
well i will try to be more consistent with my treatment plan and reach out to you if i need any adjustments can you tell me more about whats getting in your way,thats great to hear remember managing depression is a journey and its normal to have ups and downs along the way but with the right treatment and support its possible to feel better and improve your mental health sometimes you will feel that you will not complete the process but keep going this is normal
but i am afraid of missing medication appointments or regular therapy sessions with a doctor or psychiatrist at such moments and i am also afraid of reaching an irreversible stage are there any specific strategies that you think might be helpful in overcoming these barriers,i realize it can be difficult to stick to a treatment plan especially when dealing with depression it can be helpful to set reminders for yourself or create a schedule to make them easier to remember it can also be helpful to identify any obstacles or challenges that may make it difficult to follow through and to come up with strategies to overcome them for example if you set a specific goal in front of you and strive to achieve it then this is the best strategy that will help you
are there some consequences or setbacks that i can find on my way to recovery from depression,it is important to remember that managing depression is a journey and it can take time to see progress it is also important to be patient and compassionate with yourself its okay to have setbacks or to have trouble following your treatment plan the most important thing is that you keep trying and keep working on developing coping strategies to deal with your depression
well i will try to be more consistent with my treatment plan and will try again and again to maintain the treatment plan because i want to be mentally healthy again and lead a normal life is this acceptable,thats great to hear remember i am here to support you and to help you develop strategies for managing your depression during and outside of treatment feel free to get in touch if you need additional support or guidanceone of the strategies weve been working on is challenging negative thoughts if you are able to challenge your bad thoughts everything will turn out well
it was hard sometimes i feel like my negative thoughts are overwhelming and i cant stop them does this have a negative effect on my mood,all these mood disorders that you suffer from and the main cause of them is the negative thoughts that you have so you must challenge all these negative thoughts and then your mood and mental state will be regulated
negative thoughts increased and thinking about them increased and this is very stressful and stressful for mental health how do i challenge all these negative thoughts and overcome them in order to overcome depression,i realize it can be a difficult challenge but its important to remember that negative thoughts can contribute to feelings of depression challenging these thoughts can help break the cycle of negativity and help you feel more positive
not sure how to challenge my negative thoughts the negative thoughts themselves are tiring to think about and are not easy to challenge and overcome for me now are there reasons why a person is unable to get rid of his negative thoughts,this is understandable one way to challenge negative thoughts is to ask yourself if they are really true for example if youre thinking im a failure you can ask yourself if thats really true or if there are cases where youve succeeded another strategy is to think about how you would respond if your friend was saying these things about themselves
that makes sense i find it hard to believe positive things about myself sometimes because my mind is immersed in negative thoughts and negative thoughts are like a ghost that haunts me everywhere and positive thoughts represent to me something like a legend that i dont believe can positive qualities eliminate negative thoughts,this is a common experience but it is important to remember that everyone has positive qualities and accomplishments even if they are not always seen it can be helpful to write down positive things about yourself such as your strengths and accomplishments and to read them when youre feeling down
ill try it its hard to change the way i think sometimes is indulging in it for too long dangerous for my mood,yes everything is possible because its effect is dangerous when immersed in it for a long time and it harms oneself others and everything around you you must quickly get rid of all these negative thoughts
i will really accept the challenge to overcome all these thoughts because i dont want to hurt myself or others does recovery from depression take a lot of time,it may take time and practice to change negative thought patterns but it is important to keep trying remember i am here to support you and to help you develop strategies to challenge negative thoughts and control your depression
but if i fail to overcome all these bad and negative thoughts what should i do to preserve myself and everything around me,all you have to do if you dont succeed at once then try several times there is nothing that can be done the first time or on the first experience this is something that is difficult to do but it is possible to repeat
i was trying to identify negative thoughts as they came up and replace them with more positive ones but it was difficult is this normal or my condition that is not normal,it can definitely be hard especially when negative thoughts become a pattern remember that developing new thinking patterns takes time and practice
i was trying to ask myself if a negative thought was true or if there was evidence to support it then i try to come up with a more positive thought to replace it is this step useful in order to get rid of negative thoughts,thats a great start its also helpful to think about how you would respond to a friend who was going through the same negative thought you should talk to them the same way you talk to yourself and it can be helpful to offer yourself the same kindness and support you would a friend
honestly i didnt feel much connected i have been isolating myself more and more because i tend to sit alone a lot and do not like to participate in family gatherings or any gatherings what is it like to sit alone in the situation i am going through,i can understand why this might be tempting especially when youre depressed however it is important to remember that social support can be a really important part of managing depression
not really i dont want to burden anyone with my problems and no one knows what is going on inside me sometimes i feel belittled by others sometimes i feel pity for others who are the people with whom i can share such a case,i can understand why you might feel anxious but its important to remember that social support can be really helpful when it comes to managing depression even just having someone to talk to and share your experiences with can be a really important part of the healing process
im not sure i feel like its been a long time since ive spoken to anyone the reason i worry about others is because i dont trust them all and i feel like everyone is watching me is this normal or is it my condition that is difficult to deal with,its okay initiating and reconnecting can be a process and may take time it can be helpful to start with small steps like sending a text or reaching out on social media or if you feel like it you might try attending a social event or meeting someone for coffee it is important to remember that you do not have to do this alone
well im going to try to connect with someone this week i talk to him and will try to cooperate with him on anything even if its a small matter is there a specific person i should talk to,preferably someone with experience in the field of psychotherapy but if not available then you should have friends close to you this is understandable but it is important to remember that social support can be a powerful tool in managing depression
i have a close friend who i know is always there for me but i dont want to burden them with my problems what should i tell my friend about my condition so that he understands and helps me,its understandable that you feel this way but remember that true friends are there to support each other through good times and bad its also important to remember that you dont have to have all the answers or fix everything yourself sometimes just talking to someone about how you feel can be helpful in managing depression
thats right i will try to reach my friend and see if we can talk is it just me,thats great to hear and remember staying in touch doesnt have to be just about talking about your problems it can also be about engaging in activities that you enjoy or that make you feel good
what physical activities do people who suffer from the same condition as me need i used to enjoy long walks but not for long,this can be a great way to not only stay in touch with a friend but also to engage in physical activity that can be helpful in managing depression long walks running or sports in general but you must have a friend with you to encourage you to do so
well this seems like a good idea and having a friend with me motivates me i will keep doing this because it looks beautiful what about social support,thats great to hear remember that social support is just one part of managing depression but it can be an important part and as always im here to support you as you work to develop strategies to manage your depression
what if i cannot cooperate and communicate with others because there is no right person to talk to,priority should be given to friends close to you first and give yourself an opportunity to trust them and share some of your interests and daily life with them and then you will find the right person for you who is the most comfortable for you you
well that sounds like a good idea i will start trying again to find the solution needed to set my mood,great im glad we came up with a plan to help you stay connected and participate in the activities you enjoy remember i am here to support you in managing your depression and to help you develop strategies for staying connected and finding joy in life

honestly i was feeling a little down i feel like ive been working on this for a while and dont see much improvement is recovery from depression a gradual cauldron,this is understandable and it is important to remember that recovery from depression can be a gradual process it is not always a linear path and there may be setbacks along the way
what are some prescriptions i should take to deal with depression,there are many qualities that you must possess and the most important ones to be patient with yourself and to remember that every small step forward is progress
i felt a little depressed i thought i would feel better now but i still have days when i get really down did they teach him to recover from depression for a long time,of course it is important to remember that recovering from depression is a process and can take time its also normal to experience setbacks or to feel like youre not making progress as quickly as you would like the important thing is that you continue to work on managing your depression and dont hesitate to ask for help when you need it
i know but its hard to be patient with myself what do i do if i hit a small goal,it can be difficult but its important to remember that being patient with yourself is part of the process remember to celebrate the small victories along the way and recognize the progress youve made even if it doesnt feel like much right now
i feel like i should be better now because i want to go about my daily life normally and i dont know if this takes a long time what is required to be done in the journey of recovery from depression,it is common to have these feelings but it is important to challenge this negative selftalk remember that everyones journey is different and there is no timeline for recovery you do your best and thats all a person can ask of themselves
well thats good to hear i have been trying again and again for a long time and my mood has not changed what should i do,and remember you dont have to do it alone its okay to ask for help when you need it thats what im here for and there are also other resources available such as support groups or medication if thats something youre interested in exploring
i dont know if youre ready to take medication yet but maybe i could look into some support groups is depression recovery just about me and managing it,thats a great idea and remember recovery isnt just about managing symptoms its also about developing a sense of resilience and wellbeing it is a process of growth and selfdiscovery you are on the right track and i am here to support you every step of the way
i will try many times to get over this stage because i want to go back like the first to practice my life in a stable way,ok this is a very good thing and your partner always remembers that such stages need a long time to pass and therefore you have to be patient and accept all the challenges and difficulties that you face in order to pass that stage
all of this is instructions to get through this stage what a very tiring stage what are the qualities that i must have in order to overcome this,remember recovery from anxiety disorders is possible with the right treatment and selfcare be patient with yourself and dont hesitate to ask for help when you need itin the instructions above we talked about identifying triggers that may be contributing to your anxiety you must get rid of those stimuli that make you anxious and tense
i have been trying to pay attention to when my anxiety is at its worst and what seems to be causing it how can i overcome or control triggers that make me anxious,thats great to hear but you can easily overcome it when you are worried about something that you can face forcefully if it causes you fear or that you think about anything else if it is a passing situation
well ive noticed that i tend to feel more anxious when i have a lot of deadlines at work or when i feel like i dont have control of a situation or that there is something i did and the result was not what i expected or sitting with people older than me what is required of me to do in such situations,both are common causes of anxiety it is important to remember that identifying your triggers can be a useful tool in managing your anxiety when you know which situations or events tend to make you feel anxious you can develop strategies to deal with them more effectively
i can know what things make me anxious but i dont know how to deal with those situations in those situations my mind stops thinking is it normal for my mind to stop thinking at times when i am anxious or tense,yes all of this is normal but we must eliminate it as soon as possible and do not let anxiety control your mind like this and there is no need to be afraid of that in order to be balanced in your decisions you must confront all of the triggers that cause you to have an anxiety disorder
it makes sense do you have any suggestions for strategies to counter all those triggers that make me anxious to stop thinking,there are many different strategies that can be helpful depending on the individual and the situation some common strategies include deep breathing exercises progressive muscle relaxation cognitive behavioral therapy and medication we can work together to develop a plan tailored to your needs and preferences
that sounds good i am willing to try anything that may help in my condition to get rid of all this when should i do to eliminate anxiety,thats great to hear from now on you have to start confronting and overcoming every trigger that makes you anxious remember its you who make it easy and you who make it hard
how do i make the stage of getting rid of anxiety and stress easy and how do i make the stage of getting rid of anxiety difficult,you can make this boiler easy by persevering with these instructions first then taking them step by step and facing the difficulties and challenges facing you and you can make it more difficult if you dont do any of this
what about failure at that point if i dont succeed at that point what do i do,failing at this stage always causes you to lose focus and become a mentally unbalanced person if you encounter any reason for your anxiety you should always remember that such stages need people who are able to be patient and confrontational from the point of failure you should also start step by step so as not to reach the stage of failure
well it all makes sense and i am completely ready to start at that point in order to improve my mood does the process of recovering from anxiety and stress need more time,yes the recovery process takes a lot of time and this is normal remember identifying triggers and developing coping strategies is an ongoing process it may take some time to figure out what works best for you and thats okay the important thing is that you take steps to manage your anxiety and improve your overall health
anxiety disorder patient what strategies help me manage my anxiety in terms of gradual exposure to situations,gradual exposure involves confronting situations or triggers that make you anxious in a gradual and safe way we will work together to create a plan that you feel is manageable we will start with a situation that makes you feel mildly anxious and then slowly progress to more challenging situations
this sounds scary to me because any of those anxietyprovoking situations make me lose focus what is the plan for gradual exposure to situations,this is a valid concern but we will handle things at your own pace youll always be in control of your show and well take breaks when needed we can also teach you relaxation techniques and other coping strategies to use during exposure
well all this talk is very good and gets me excited but i want to get down to business how do i begin to get rid of stress and anxiety through gradual exposure to situations,we will first identify the situations or triggers that make you anxious once we have a list we can prioritize them based on how challenging they are to you then well start with the least challenging position and gradually work our way up
can you give me an example how do i deal with situations that make me anxious lose focus disoriented or restless,i understand it can be scary but gradual exposure can actually help you overcome your anxiety over time we can work together to create a plan that feels safe and manageable for you it is important to start small and gradually work your way up to more challenging situations
i want to know more about how i manage my anxiety especially in front of the public,well lets say your motivator is public speaking well start by exposing you to a less intimidating situation like speaking in front of a small group of people you feel comfortable with once you are comfortable with it we will gradually increase the difficulty of situations such as speaking in front of larger groups or with people you dont know either the goal is to help you build confidence and reduce anxiety over time
what should i do in crowded places that make me more stressed and anxious,absolutely lets say one of your triggers is being in a crowded place like a shopping mall well start by having you imagine youre in a less crowded store such as a convenience store while using relaxation techniques once you are comfortable with that we move on to a slightly crowded store such as a supermarket and well keep working our way until you feel comfortable in a busy mall
that makes sense but i still worry about feeling overwhelmed and the large numbers of the audience makes me confused as well what techniques help me reduce stress and anxiety,this is completely understandable we will work together to create a plan that feels safe and manageable for you we will also teach you coping strategies to use during exposure such as relaxation techniques or cognitive behavioral therapy techniques youll be in control of the pace of the show and well make sure we take breaks when needed
i see logical how long does this process take,the length of the process varies from person to person it depends on the severity of your anxiety and how quickly you feel comfortable with the progression well take things at your own pace and make adjustments as needed
well that sounds reasonable what are some other things i can do to manage my anxiety,in addition to stepwise exposure we can also work on cognitive behavioral techniques such as identifying and challenging negative thoughts we can also explore relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation to help you calm your mind and body and we can discuss lifestyle changes that can help reduce stress and anxiety such as exercise and healthy eating
hi i was feeling anxious as usual i feel like my anxiety is taking over my life and im not sure how to deal with it what about the next stage of treatment to recover from anxiety and tension,i understand how overwhelming anxiety can be the next stage of recovery is cognitive behavioral therapy cbt
ive heard about it but dont really know much about it so i dont even give it a try because i dont know anything about it except its name and i dont have any energy to look it up because im going through a phase of anxiety disorder that upsets my mood a lot what is cognitive behavioral therapy cbt,cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of treatment that focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety it can be very effective in treating anxiety disorders the goal of cbt is to help you learn specific skills to manage your symptoms and gradually return to activities youve been avoiding because of anxiety
this sounds like something that could really work for me but im not regular or erratic about doing anything but lets give it a try how do we start in the stage of cognitive behavioral therapy,well everything in those stages that you are going through needs to be patient so that you can overcome that stage in terms of perseverance everything will be easier step by step well start by identifying the negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to your anxiety next we will work to change those thoughts and behaviors by challenging negative thoughts and practicing relaxation techniques
what kind of relaxation techniques will be useful in such cases in order for me to start them to have a good and effective effect and on the other hand will it be easy for me at first,we might use deep breathing exercises progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation these techniques can help you calm your mind and body when you start to feel anxious
sounds like it could be really helpful what about the stepbystep plan i mentioned earlier,yes this is another technique that we use in cbt we will work together to devise a plan to gradually introduce you to the things that trigger your anxiety starting with the less difficult situations and working our way up to the more difficult ones
this sounds scary its hard to deal with him in the circumstances hes in because when im worried i dont know what to do is it normal to deal with this stage of cbt in my case,yes of course it can be scary at first but its important to remember that the goal is to help you feel more comfortable and confident in these situations over time we will proceed at a pace that feels safe and manageable for you
well that makes sense how long does cbt usually take,it depends on the person and the severity of his anxiety but cbt is a shortterm treatment that lasts between 820 sessions
that doesnt sound very long but i will work hard to try to get rid of this stage as soon as possible and in fewer sessions what is cbt and how is it useful for my condition,right cbt is designed to be a brief focused treatment that teaches you specific skills to manage your anxiety of course well go at the pace youre comfortable with and reassess as we go to make sure were on the right track
well that sounds good i am willing to try anything to feel better but how long will it take for the cognitive behavioral therapy phase to recover from anxiety and stress,great im glad to hear that remember that managing anxiety is a process that takes time and effort but with the right skills and support its definitely possible to feel better
but what happens if at this point i cant handle it because i lose my temper so easily when anxiety creeps up on me,this is a very good talk but first these rules that we follow prevent the infiltration of anxiety and put you in a good mood most of the time but on one condition which is perseverance and regularity in those rules because if you do not persevere you will reach the stage that you do not want to reach from anxiety and general tension and it will be difficult to treat it so it is preferable to adhere to these rules to skip this stage
im not happy to hear this but im curious about what stage id be at if i didnt stick to these rules what if i do not attend the stage of behavioral therapy,stress and anxiety can make you lose your temper a little but now you know how to control it in the advanced stages you do not know how to control it because it is very difficult to control it and this can lead to serious harm to yourself and everyone around you you are indispensable all this is that you follow the rules and instructions to get through this stage safely and securely
this is really scary stuff i will persevere with these instructions in order to get through this stage so lets get started what if i dont succeed in the initial stages,very nice words and i am with you at any time if you dont succeed on your first attempt you can do another and another and another until you reach your desired goal which is to get past this stage and get back to the healthy state of mind youve been enjoying
thank you and ill start with these instructions and see you soon,can we talk about the importance of positive selftalk in managing anxiety you should try to replace negative selftalk with positive selftalk
not really i usually have a lot of negative thoughts and its hard to change them negative selfthinking is the dominant thought in my mind when im feeling stressed is replacing negative selftalk with positive selftalk an important step towards eliminating anxiety and stress,yes one of the most important stages is to be confident in yourself and selfconfidence comes from positive selftalk and not negative selftalk because if you do that it helps you a lot in managing stress and anxiety good
i often try to talk positively about myself but thinking negatively about myself is also a tyrant at a time of stress and anxiety what methods or strategies help me get rid of negative selftalk,positive selftalk can be an effective way to manage anxiety the first of these strategies is not to underestimate yourself no matter what and you should celebrate the little things and not underestimate the affairs of the small things because these things are your way to the desired goal
i think so they are the things we tell ourselves in our heads how does positive selftalk help manage my anxiety,yes exactly the way we talk to ourselves can have a huge impact on how we feel negative selftalk can fuel anxiety while positive selftalk can help us feel more confident and capable
yes i tend to think things like im not good enough or i cant handle this what should i do in order to overcome these negative patterns,these are common patterns of negative selftalk it is important to challenge these thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts for example if you find yourself thinking i cant handle this try replacing it with something like this is a challenge but i can take this one step at a time
this seems helpful but how do i remember to do this in the moment when i feel anxious,it can be hard to remember in the moment especially when the anxiety is intense this is why it is helpful to practice positive selftalk regularly even when you are not feeling anxious you can also try using reminders like setting an alarm on your phone or writing notes to yourself
it makes sense can you give me some examples of positive selftalk statements,of course some examples are âi can handle thisâ âi am strong and capableâ âi am making progressâ âi am in control of my thoughts and feelingsâ âi deserve and deserve love and respectâ but its important to find phrases that resonate with you personally so feel free to come up with your own as well
okay im going to try to practice this thank you for the suggestion does challenging negative thoughts help me adjust my mood,this is understandable but negative selftalk can increase anxiety and make it difficult to deal with stressful situations one way to start changing this pattern is to identify negative thoughts and replace them with positive supportive statements
can you give me an example of how i can talk positively about myself at times when i am feeling anxious or stressed,sure lets say you have a job interview coming up and you feel anxious your negative selftalk might be saying things like im not good enough for this job or im going to screw up the interview instead you can replace these thoughts with positive selftalk like i am qualified for this job or i have prepared well for this interview and will do my best
it makes sense but how do i actually start doing that in order to get over that stage that makes me psychologically unbalanced,it takes practice but one way is to start paying attention to your thoughts and noticing when they are negative then consciously replace those thoughts with positive thoughts you can even write down your negative thoughts and come up with positive affirmations to replace them
okay ill try that is there anything else i can do to promote positive selftalk,yes you can also try practicing gratitude and focusing on the positive in your life this can help change the way you think and make it easier to engage in positive selftalk its also important to be kind and sympathetic to yourself especially when youve made mistakes or faced challenges
what should i do if i do not succeed in overcoming it or do it to avoid stress,there is nothing you should do except one thing which is to try again and try again and again to avoid failure and there is nothing that comes with one attempt so you must try many times to reach the goal
i have a hard time getting started on tasks especially when im feeling anxious is it normal for anxiety to affect my life as well,this is understandable sometimes yes anxiety can make it hard to focus and get started on tasks
not really i usually try to avoid the task altogether i tend to avoid tasks that i find overwhelming or stressful but then feel guilty for not doing them its like a vicious circle what should i do to get rid of stress and anxiety in order to live a normal life,i see it is common for people with anxiety to feel overwhelmed and avoid tasks that trigger their anxiety however procrastination can make anxiety worse in the long run it is important that you try to break the cycle by completing tasks as they arise or breaking down larger tasks into smaller more manageable steps
it makes sense but its hard to get started sometimes because the beginning is the hardest step because i dont know where to start where do i start in the face of anxiety to complete the tasks required of me,i understand that getting started can be difficult sometimes it can be helpful to set yourself small goals and reward yourself for achieving them this can help create a sense of accomplishment and motivation it can also be helpful to challenge any negative thoughts that may be holding you back such as i cant do this or its too hard instead try replacing those with more positive and encouraging ones such as i can do this or ive done challenging tasks before
okay ill try that but what if i still feel overwhelmed,if you are still feeling overwhelmed it is important to take a break and practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation these techniques can help you feel more calm focused and reduce your anxiety and remember its okay to ask for help if you need it you can always reach out to me or other support resources if you need additional support
thank you i appreciate that i will try to be more proactive and break down tasks into smaller steps i will also try to challenge my negative thoughts and practice relaxation techniques what qualities should i have when dealing with anxiety and stress,that sounds like a good plan remember it takes time and practice to overcome procrastination and manage anxiety but with the right tools and support it is possible to make progress and feel more in control i suggest that you try to set specific goals for yourself and create a schedule or todo list this can help you stay organized and focused breaking down large tasks into smaller manageable steps can also help you avoid feeling overwhelmed
sounds like a good idea but what if i dont want to do the task even after breaking it down into smaller steps,its good not to always feel motivated to complete a task but its important to keep taking action one technique you can try is the five minute rule set the timer for 5 minutes and commit to working on the task for that amount of time once the five minutes are up you can reassess how you feel and decide if you want to continue working on the task or take a break
this is helpful advice i will give it a try,remember that avoiding tasks can increase anxiety by creating a sense of urgency and tension by taking action and completing tasks as they arise you can reduce stress and feel more in control
i havent really thought about it but im willing to try anything that might help what about skills that help me manage my anxiety,great there are a lot of different coping skills we can work on one approach that can be really effective for anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy or cbt for short this type of therapy focuses on changing negative thought patterns that may be contributing to anxiety and developing new coping skills
this sounds interesting i dont use it during my previous attempt and this seems like an easy approach to dealing with these situations how do all of these techniques that help me manage anxiety and stress work so well,well in cbt we start by identifying the negative thoughts that are contributing to your anxiety for example if youre worried about giving a presentation at work we might explore thoughts that make you anxious such as im going to fail and everyone will think im stupid
thats exactly how i feel during exposure to any stimuli that raises my tension or anxiety what should i do to adapt to assistive technologies in managing my anxiety,ok so once we identify those negative thoughts we work to challenge them we might look for evidence that contradicts those ideas or restate them in a more positive way for example instead of thinking im going to fail and everyone will think im stupid we might rephrase it as im going to do my best and even if i make a mistake its not the end of the world
it makes sense and that sounds good but im going to try to follow all of these instructions to get through the situation im in and get out of it are there specific strategies for controlling anxiety,the other part of cbt is developing new coping skills for example we might work on relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation or we may practice exposure therapy where we gradually expose you to situations or stimuli that make you anxious to help you build your tolerance over time
this seems really helpful how long does it usually take to see results,it can vary from person to person but we usually see improvement within a few weeks to a few months it is important to keep in mind that recovering from anxiety is a process and it may take time but with practice and perseverance i believe you can learn how to manage your anxiety in a more effective way
okay this makes me feel hopeful,thats great to hear is there anything else youd like to talk about or have any questions about cbt
no i think i understand that im ready to give it a try,great im here to support you every step of the way let us work together to help you manage your anxiety and feel more in control of your life
i feel lost and confused ive been struggling with addiction for a while now and it was hard to deal with on my own i dont know how to deal with these situations who helps me get out of this situation,i understand how difficult addiction is but you take the first step by asking for help from some specialists or even from me or if you do not need a specialist you should talk to those close to you
i dont think of such a thing because i feel like ive let my loved ones down and i feel ashamed to admit i have a problem and i see this problem as a stigma on me is there anything useful to help me manage my addiction,it is common to feel shame or guilt about addiction but that is not what you think and there is no stigma one thing that can be helpful in managing addiction is building a support system
do you think that seeking help from others is the beginning of correcting this mistake how do i ask for help from others to overcome this ordeal,thats a good question and you should talk to friends that you feel comfortable with talk honestly and tell them everything youre going through and your loved ones may be more understanding and supportive than you think and joining a support group can provide a safe nonjudgmental environment for you to share your experiences and connect with others who have gone through similar hardships
i see what youre saying but im still hesitating what if i dont feel comfortable sharing my story with strangers,this is understandable it is important to find a support group that feels right for you you can start by researching different groups in your area and attending some meetings to get a sense of the group dynamic 
thats a good idea i think i would feel more comfortable speaking with a professional should i speak to a professional in the field and why,yes thats understandable because a therapist can help you identify triggers and develop coping strategies specific to your needs they may also provide a safe and confidential space for you to work through any emotional issues that may be contributing to your addiction
i am willing to try anything to get better what other support options are there,another option is to connect with a recovery coach or mentor they can provide guidance and support as you navigate the recovery process you may also consider involving your family and loved ones in the recovery process by attending family therapy sessions together
well thats a good idea what about my loved ones how can i deal with them about my addiction,it can be difficult to have those conversations but honesty and vulnerability are key tell them you have an addiction and seek help explain how important it is to support the recovery process and ask for their understanding and patience you can also ask if they would be willing to attend family therapy or support groups with you to strengthen your relationship and improve communication
i understand that but what if no one in my family helps me with my addiction,this is good especially in those days no one loves good for anyone but there is your family and they are the first to want to help you or your close friends as well as support you to get through this ordeal but you must stay away from bad friends
what if i fail this trial and cant talk to anyone to help me,getting rid of addiction especially alcohol and alcohol takes a long time to get rid of and you have to be patient and challenged to be able to face the problem you are going through so that you do not reach less than that from that i dont know how to get rid of it
what is worse than addiction is there anything worse than that,yes there is something worse than your stage and now you can get rid of it easily or with some difficulty and it all depends on how strong your personality is in getting rid of addiction the more you want to get rid of addiction the faster you will recover from it
i see this is very logical thanks for your guidance,ok remember building a support system takes time and effort but it is an important step toward managing addiction and achieving recovery im here to support you all the way
honestly i feel a little overwhelmed i have tried to quit alcohol and alcohol before but i always had to relapse does addiction need good planning for recovery,yes it needs planning and its understandable that you feel this way because youre falling behind without a plan and these are things you need to plan for and recover from but creating a plan can help give you structure and support lets start by defining your goals
i want to stop using drugs and alcohol completely i also want to repair the relationships that have been damaged by my addiction what are the strategies or techniques that help me achieve quitting addiction,these are great goals lets focus on creating strategies to achieve those goals among them put your goals in front of you in order to challenge your thoughts to reach your goal which is to quit smoking and always improve your behavior and yourself
i want to be sober for a long time and feel in control of my life what are some things i can do to avoid drug and alcohol abuse,great lets break that down into smaller more specific goals and in order not to get tired of the routine in order to reach a great extent and the big goal you must divide it into small goals and with them you will reach the larger goal
okay i can try to get involved in situations where i am inclined to use my support system and reach out when i need it what are the activities that must be done in order to recover from addiction,this is a good start you should engage in group work with people who modify your behavior not the other way around because it is important at that stage for the people in the surrounding environment to motivate you to recover and also to do some sporting activities
well when i feel anxious or stressed ive found that exercise or meditation can help i also like to keep a journal to help me process my thoughts and feelings is it normal for relapses in the steps to quit smoking,these are great coping strategies lets incorporate it into your plan too and yes of course there are many setbacks but for people who do not have the will and inner determination and do not want change from themselves setbacks are a normal part of the process but having a plan can help you stay on track and work toward your goals
i have some supportive and understanding friends im also open to joining a support group such as detox communities does this support help me quit addiction,of course thats excellent having a support system is critical to recovery finally lets talk about any potential obstacles or challenges that may arise in your recovery
what should i do if i do not succeed in this step because it is difficult for me to talk to someone about my addiction,i know that certain situations or social stimuli can be difficult for me to deal with so but you can plan ahead and devise alternative activities or coping strategies in those situations
hello nice to meet you too ive been struggling with addiction for a while now and its really affecting my life i feel like ive lost control and need help is there anything that helps me control my addiction,absolutely setting boundaries means defining what behaviors or attitudes are acceptable to you and communicating them to the people around you it is about clearly articulating your needs and making sure they are respected
how can setting boundaries behavioral help me manage my addiction,well addiction often involves people or situations that enable or lead to addictive behavior by setting boundaries you can create a safer environment for yourself and reduce your risk of relapse for example if you have friends who encourage you to drink or take drugs you can tell them that you can no longer hang out with them when they are drinking or drinking
that makes sense but how do i set these limits to control my addiction and then recover from addiction,i see well an important aspect of addiction management is setting boundaries because setting boundaries means that you want a change for the better which is an important step towards addiction recovery
no i did not try to set limits for myself in dealing with others because i do not have control over myself when i need to use narcotic substances who are the people that should be avoided and who should be approached,an important first step to moving away from drug and alcohol use is to set boundaries for yourself in dealing with others especially those who help you with the abuse and to be close to loved ones who help you move away from it have you tried many times to set limits on dealing
yes i have but i dont really know how to do it i feel like i dont have much control over my life right now how do i set limits for myself while i am addicted,i see it can be hard to set boundaries especially when addiction is taking over your life but setting clear boundaries and sticking to them can be really helpful in managing your addiction lets start by talking about some of the people or situations that trigger your addiction
well i have some friends who are always drinking or doing drugs and its hard for me to say no when im around them i also tend to get addicted when im stressed or anxious what boundaries do you think you can set with people who drink,well those are good examples so lets focus on friends who do drugs or drink you can stay away from them by approaching people who improve your behavior or by not dealing with these people at all
i can tell them im trying to be sober and i cant be around this kind of behavior anymore i can also try to avoid situations where i know they are going to drink or do drugs what strategies should be used while setting boundaries in decisions,thats a lot it is important to remember that you have the right to say no to the things that dont work for you it may be hard at first but sticking to these limits can really help you in the long run
i can try to identify my triggers and find healthy ways to deal with stress and anxiety i can also try to remove myself from stressful situations or find ways to relax when im feeling overwhelmed are all these steps important in recovering from addiction,thats a great start remember setting boundaries isnt about being rigid or inflexible its about taking care of yourself and your wellbeing its okay to adjust your boundaries as you go but its important to put them in place so you can continue to recover
yes i have some information about the concept of accountability but i havent tried it yet and im not sure how it applies to my situation what is accountability in general,well accountability means taking responsibility for your actions and being willing to accept the consequences of those actions in the context of addiction it means being responsible for your recovery and taking steps to make sure youre on the right track this could include sharing your recovery plan with a trusted friend or family member and asking them to check in with you regularly how do you feel about it
im not sure sounds like a good idea but i dont know if i want to share this part of my life with anyone else how does accountability help me recover from addiction,i understand that it can be difficult to share something as personal as addiction with others but having someone to hold you accountable can be really helpful in keeping you on the right track to recovery and you dont have to be someone who knows all the details of your addiction you can simply ask a friend or family member to check in with you regularly to see what you are doing and offer support
well i see what you mean but dont you think sharing such things makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed,its understandable to feel embarrassed or ashamed if you make a mistake but its important to remember that addiction is a disease and recovery is a process its not about perfection or never making mistakes the important thing is to learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward having someone to hold you accountable can help you do this and if you do make a mistake it is important to be honest about it and not try to hide it from your accountability partner
that makes sense i guess i could ask my family or a trusted friend to be my accountability partner they have been really supportive of me in the past is seeking help in such addictive situations a good thing,yes it sounds like a good idea remember to be clear with them about what you need from them as a responsible partner you can ask them to check in with you regularly offer encouragement and support and help you stay on track with your recovery plan
but we come to the worst part what if i dont succeed in this step because i am unable to do what i say and therefore irresponsible,do not worry i know that addiction only makes you happy for a temporary period but recovering from it at that time will be in a good psychological state all the time because you have reached your goal and you will be in the eyes of a person who is able to take responsibility and the ability to face challenges but remember if you fail at that point all these positives will turn into negatives and you will enter a critical stage that you do not want to reach
all of these positives are good and indeed this is what i want to achieve but i also want to know what critical stage i will be at if i dont recover at that point,the critical stage is the complete absence of selfcontrol and addiction is the main driver for you and therefore it is difficult to recover from it at that stage because at that time you need a specialist in this field and you need to move to a clinic to treat addiction and its time and it is difficult to recover at that stage so make yourself a good person to yourself and help the participants recover at that point and you are in charge
i am sad to hear about this critical stage and i do not want to reach it my goal is to get to the positives i like to be and to be a good person in the eyes of the participants at this point what qualities should i have during that period in which i recover from addiction through accountability,im glad to hear that i am also glad that you showed your determination and strength in accepting the challenge to change for the better and be a better person and waiting for the best person you want and be a patient and strong person and bear the burdens and responsibilities well
no i havent im so focused on the big picture of recovery that i havent really thought about celebrating the little milestones along the way does celebrating small victories help me recover from addiction,yes thats understandable but its important to recognize and celebrate the progress youre making no matter how small recovery is a journey and it can be easy to get frustrated if we dont take the time to acknowledge our successes
that makes sense but what kind of small victories should i celebrate,it could be anything that shows progress toward recovery goals for example completing a week of sobriety resisting a trigger or temptation reaching a milestone in your recovery plan or even just having a good day when you feel more in control it is important to write down these moments and acknowledge the hard work that went into achieving them
i see how can i celebrate these small victories,you can do something that makes you feel good and helps you relax such as treating yourself to a special meal or activity taking the day off to rest playing a sport you love or spending time with loved ones who support your recovery  you can also pat yourself and acknowledge the hard work that went into achieving this achievement it is important to celebrate in a way that feels meaningful and motivates you
i like the idea of treating myself to something special but wouldnt that make me want to indulge my addiction again,its understandable to worry about this but celebrating small victories in a healthy way can actually strengthen your commitment to recovery it helps to know that your hard work is paying off and can motivate you to continue down this path plus celebrating in a healthy way shows that you dont need your addiction to feel good or reward yourself
but my question here is what happens if i reward myself for a good deed that i did or something bad that i got rid of by taking some drugs or some alcohol,of course this is not a good thing and this is called reward this is called betrayal and weakness and i see that you are a person who is not like that and i was offered to you previously after the rewards that you get without harming yourself or violating the rules or instructions until you recover completely
honestly i feel a bit stuck i find it hard to stay motivated and my cravings are hard to resist are there other tips to help me recover well and quickly,i understand how hard it is yes there are a lot of instructions especially when you feel stuck including participating in any support group meetings
i didnt really think about it not sure how that will help me how does participating in any support group meetings help me recover from addiction,well support group meetings like alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous can provide a safe and supportive space to share experiences and learn from others who have gone through similar struggles it can also be a great way to hold yourself accountable and stay motivated
im not sure im comfortable sharing my experiences with strangers how do support groups deal with addicts and do they provide confidentiality,this is completely understandable sharing your experiences with others can be daunting especially when it comes to addiction recovery however support group meetings are completely confidential and you can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with it can also be helpful to hear from others who have gone through similar conflicts and learn about their coping mechanisms and recovery strategies
this actually sounds like it might help how often are these meetings held,varies by group and location but most support group meetings have regular weekly or fortnightly meetings i can help you find a group in your area if youre interested
to be honest i was feeling really frustrated its hard to stay motivated to change my behavior what about motivational therapy met,motivational therapy is an approach that helps increase peoples desire for change it can be useful for improving adherence and motivation to start and stay in treatment it includes a series of counseling sessions that help you define your goals and values and work towards them in a more positive way
that sounds fun how it works,at met we work together to define your personal goals as well as any potential barriers that may prevent you from achieving them next we explore ways to overcome these barriers and increase your motivation to change your behaviour it is a collaborative approach which means that you are actively involved in the treatment and the decisions that are made
sounds like it could be really helpful how many sessions does it usually take,the number of sessions can vary depending on your individual needs and goals usually we will start with an initial assessment session to get a sense of your goals and any barriers you may be facing from there we will work together to create a treatment plan that outlines the number of sessions required
that sounds good what can i expect during the sessions,during the sessions we will talk about your personal goals and any obstacles that may prevent you from achieving them we will also explore ways to overcome these barriers and increase your motivation to change your behaviour it is important to note that met is a collaborative approach so you will be actively involved in treatment and the decisions that are made
this seems really helpful how do i get started with met,i can refer you to a therapist who specializes in motivational enhancement therapy together we can create a treatment plan that works for you and your individual needs
no i didnt im afraid it may be an unusual case and i dont want to share any of my problems i didnt want to bother them with my problems who is the health care provider,this is not called inconvenience this is a problem that must be solved so that it does not get worse if it worsens it will result in a dangerous stage for you as well as for your new baby the health care provider is the doctor who follows up with you on your mood and your babyâs state of health after birth it is preferable that you talk to him about that positions
im sad to hear this do you have some solutions to this problem,yes the solutions to this stage are summarized in perseverance and regularity with all those instructions and rules that we mentioned previously and that we are talking about in the first rule of which is to share this problem with a specialist or a doctor who specializes in you caregiver
well im going to do this to avoid making it worse which i really dont want to do how does a health care provider help me with my postpartum depression,it is important to speak up and seek help when you are experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety it is a medical condition that requires professional treatment your healthcare provider can provide guidance and support in managing your condition
i didnt realize it was serious what type of treatment can i expect,there are many treatment options available for postpartum depression and anxiety your healthcare provider may recommend treatment medication or a combination of the two treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy can help you learn coping skills and strategies for managing your symptoms medications can help balance the chemicals in your brain and relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety
that makes sense but i want to be better able to manage this condition so what else can i do to manage my condition,creating a support system can be helpful in managing postpartum depression and anxiety reach out to loved ones and consider joining a support group for new moms it can also be helpful to take care of yourself by getting enough sleep eating healthy and exercising regularly
i will do my best to do these things its just hard to find energy and motivation does postpartum depression recovery take a long time,it is understandable recovering from postpartum depression or anxiety is a process and can take time be patient with yourself and dont hesitate to ask for help when you need it your healthcare provider therapist and support system are here to help you with that
hi thanks for the question honestly i was feeling overwhelmed and sometimes that exhaustion would turn into stress and anxiety how do i deal with this exhaustion anxiety and stress that has accompanied me since birth,im sorry to hear that getting enough sleep eating healthy and exercising regularly can help improve your mental health
i know but it was hard finding the time and energy to do these things i feel like im always taking care of the baby and i dont have any time for myself how does physical rest help me overcome anxiety and stress that have accompanied me since birth,i can understand that its important to prioritize your wellbeing too there must be someone who can help you take care of the baby so that you can take some time for yourself specifically in the first period right after birth in order to overcome this situation
my partner helps me when he can but not constantly because hes busy too and that makes me first and last in charge of the baby most of the time and that puts me in an unstable mood are there other people who can help me get through this stage,this is difficult but there is your healthcare provider who can help you in this situation they may be able to offer you some support or resources
i havent spoken to him since he was born but i will im not sure if what im feeling is normal or if its something more serious will the caregiver have a role in this,its always a good idea to see your healthcare provider postpartum depression and anxiety are common conditions that can be treated so its important to seek professional help if you need it and now you are in a state of it
thats good to know ive been hesitant to ask for help because i dont want to sound like a bad mom will this give a bad impression of me to the caregiver,asking for help is a sign of strength not weakness taking care of your own mental health is just as important as taking care of your childs needs remember that if you are not feeling well it can be difficult to be fully present and engaged with your child this is very normal and these are common conditions and can be treated by seeking professional help
that makes sense what else can i do to take care of my mental and physical health,in addition to seeking professional help and taking care of your physical health it may also be helpful to practice selfcare and stress management techniques this can include things like meditation mindfulness deep breathing exercises and engaging in hobbies or activities that you enjoy
all of these ideas sound great i will try to incorporate it into my routine but what if you fail at that point,in such cases of depression the sufferer needs one thing to overcome it and that is to be patient and determined so if you fail the first try dont mind trying more times until you can take care of your baby without the help of others
well thats fine i will try again and again to get through this stage for the sake of my childs life thanks for your help and support,of course always here to help remember that taking care of yourself is important not only to you but to your baby as well lets work together to create a plan to manage postpartum depression and anxiety
it was really hard i just feel so overwhelmed all the time like i cant handle everything that comes with being a new mom are there strategies other than getting enough physical rest,i see its completely normal to feel this way and its important to know that youre not alone in this the only thing that may be beneficial is taking care of your physical health do you get enough sleep and follow a healthy diet in addition to stimulating blood circulation with sports activities that help you build a healthy body
ive been trying but finding the time and energy to do these things has been hard what should i do besides parenting and how do i find time for all these instructions,i can imagine however taking care of your physical health can really help improve your mental health so i encourage you to try making some small changes to improve those areas of your life and find time to do all of these tips by asking your health care provider or relative for help
well i will try to ask one of my friends or family to help me take care of the newborn so that i can get some rest what should i ask for help with,thats great another thing that might be helpful is asking for help when you need it dont be afraid to reach out to friends family or other sources of support to help with tasks like cooking cleaning or babysitting
i feel guilty when i ask for help and i have to be able to handle everything on my own because this is my life and they have nothing wrong with it so i think i should do all these responsibilities on my own do i feel afraid or hurt,its completely understandable that you feel this way but its important to remember that its okay to ask for help you dont have to do everything alone and sometimes having that extra support can make all the difference
well ill try to keep that in mind i was hesitant to seek professional help but now with your help i did and sought help from my caregiver how can seeking help from a health care provider help me manage the anxiety and stress caused by childbirth,great finally i would like to remind you that postpartum depression or anxiety is a medical condition that requires professional treatment a mental health professional or health care provider can provide guidance and support in managing your condition so dont hesitate to ask for help if you need it
i am reluctant to ask those close to me for help do you think they get a bad impression of me and that im not up to the task,this does not exist and do not think about it because this is normal and all new mothers go through it and seeking help from him is important for you and your child
i feel good but i have some exhaustion stress and anxiety since giving birth because i dont know how to handle the baby are there organizations or associations specialized in learning this,im sorry to hear that it is important to remember that postpartum depression and anxiety are medical conditions that require professional treatment
who is the person who specializes in making me not anxious or tense that childbirth caused me,there are many people who specialize in this treatment stage and i am also here to help you i offer advice and instructions for you to recover from that and there are also psychiatrists and psychiatrists if necessary to take any chemicals
how can a person who specializes in treating postpartum depression help me,everyone helps you and gives you advice through talking i and the therapists do that they provide advice in the form of conversations in order to recover from depression the other is a psychiatrist and this is an advanced stage if it is necessary to take medicine or chemicals and electrocution sessions
are there other steps that should be taken to recover from postpartum disorder,ok this is a good step towards treatment from that stage and along with your health care provider you should attend seminars and meetings that explain how to deal with all those conditions you are going through and help you organize your time
